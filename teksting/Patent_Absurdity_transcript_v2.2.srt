1
00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:14,314
These people are lined up to hear the oral
argument in the first software patent case
to be brought before the Supreme Court
in almost 30 years

2
00:00:14,564 --> 00:00:16,990
<i>- Do you guys want to introduce yourselves
and spell your names?</i>

3
00:00:17,882 --> 00:00:21,729
- Yeah, uh, uh, Bernie Bilski. B - I - L - S - K - I

4
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:30,302
- Rand - R - A - N - D, Warsaw - W-A-R-S-A-W

5
00:00:30,552 --> 00:00:33,268
<i>- Could you guys tell us in a nutshell
what you've invent?</i>

6
00:00:33,318 --> 00:00:39,498
- The invention is a guaranteed energy bill,
which is like a budget bill without a true-up,-

7
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:46,768
-and it's a method of hedging both sides in the
transaction. So, behind giving consumers,-

8
00:00:47,018 --> 00:00:50,518
-energy consumers are guaranteed energy bill.
There's a lot of mechanics.

9
00:00:50,768 --> 00:00:54,468
And the mechanics involve financial transactions
between energy consumption,

10
00:00:54,718 --> 00:00:58,218
or energy consumers, and the energy providers.

11
00:00:58,468 --> 00:01:03,830
THESE MEN HOPE TO GAIN A PATENT ON
A BUSINESS METHOD OF HEDGING
COMMODITY RISK

12
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:08,994
And that's what the invention is in a nutshell.
It's a method of generating guaranteed bills-

13
00:01:09,244 --> 00:01:12,744
-for consumers and, also, for protecting
energy company earnings.

14
00:01:12,994 --> 00:01:16,743
The outcome of the case will have profound
implications for software

15
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:22,190
- The Bilski Case itself is someone applied for a
patent on a business method or software,-

16
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,396
-and patent office rejected it. And now this is
that person suing the patent office, saying-

17
00:01:27,396 --> 00:01:30,390
-"You have to grant me that patent."

18
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,140
This case is about what does it mean to be
a patentable process.

19
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,913
And so, since software patents fall under the
category of processes, because they are not-

20
00:01:39,163 --> 00:01:43,166
-the machine, and they're not a composition of
matter, which are some of the other categories-

21
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:47,357
-of things that are patentable. This case will
define what it means to be a patentable process.

22
00:01:52,257 --> 00:01:54,276
<i>- What about justice Roberts? He said, you know,</i>

23
00:01:54,468 --> 00:01:57,452
<i>basically your patent involves people picking
up the phone and calling other people.</i>

24
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:03,065
- It could be reduced to that level, as the certain acts
that are performed, but it's much more than that.

25
00:02:03,365 --> 00:02:08,438
It has to do with selling commodity that effects
price to one party, selling to a different party

26
00:02:08,738 --> 00:02:12,706
at a different fixed price,
identifying counter risk positions.

27
00:02:12,956 --> 00:02:18,668
If you look at claim four in the patent, we have things
called claims which describes what the invention is, -

28
00:02:18,668 --> 00:02:25,318
-there's a long mathematical formula in there, that
didn't exist in nature or anywhere in the literature,

29
00:02:25,502 --> 00:02:28,110
that these very inventive folks come up with.

30
00:02:28,352 --> 00:02:32,052
<i>- Once upon a time math was not patentable.
And nowadays we can have someone -</i>

31
00:02:32,302 --> 00:02:37,812
-like Bilski coming in and saying: "You know,
I worked hard on this mathematical equation -"

32
00:02:38,012 --> 00:02:41,564
"- and therefor I should have a patent on this
information processing method here."

33
00:02:41,814 --> 00:02:45,249
<i>- You mention in your claim that there's a very long
calculation shown there.</i>

34
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:50,710
<i>Do you think a strong calculation or good math
is a basis for a patent?</i>

35
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,714
- It can be.

36
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:57,710
- The basic process of writing software is that you
take a broad algorithm of some sort, you know, -

37
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,760
-some means of doing something with abstract data,
and then you apply variable names.

38
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,910
- So for our first derivation let's start with a simple
matrix, a matrix of values.

39
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,830
And we'll find the mean of each column, mu one,
mu two, mu three.

40
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:21,184
And we're gonna define Y to be X minus
mu for each column.

41
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:29,468
Now if we have some other factor, X, we can take
X dot S and find the projection of X onto this space.

42
00:03:29,718 --> 00:03:31,950
This is called the singular value decomposition (SVD).

43
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:41,609
Now, here's the trick. Here's the great part. Let's
say that this first row, X1, equals sexuality.

44
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:45,359
Let's say X2 equals "Do you own cats?"

45
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:51,836
And X3 equals, I dunno, affection.

46
00:03:55,022 --> 00:04:05,502
Ok, so, now we'll also say that, let's take a factor
J1 equals Jane's responses on this survey.

47
00:04:05,752 --> 00:04:10,086
Let's say J2 equals Joe's responses.

48
00:04:10,336 --> 00:04:21,308
Now let's do the same projections as we did before.
We're gonna take J1 dot S subtract J2 dot S.

49
00:04:21,558 --> 00:04:27,062
We're gonna find the distance between these two
points, and we're gonna call that compatibility.

50
00:04:28,414 --> 00:04:35,901
And in that simple step, we've derived patent
number 6 735 568.

51
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:44,286
The trick of our derivation was that before with
the SVD, we had abstract numbers.

52
00:04:44,536 --> 00:04:49,974
What the guys at eHarmony did to get this patent,
was to assign names to our variables.

53
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:55,870
So instead of an abstract X1 we have sexuality,
instead of X2 we have a preference for cats.

54
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,948
And by making those assignments, by
setting variable names in this matter, -

55
00:05:00,198 --> 00:05:05,390
-they were able to take an abstract concept
and turn it into a patentable device.

56
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:13,569
- What we want to do according to the heads of
our patent institutions, is take mathematics and

57
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:18,246
slice it up into as many slices as possible, and hand
those slices out. And, say, if you do a

58
00:05:18,496 --> 00:05:26,238
principle component analysis, if you multiply matrices
for dating sites, we'll give that to eHarmony.

59
00:05:26,488 --> 00:05:31,532
If it's for equities we'll give that to State Street. And
so on and so forth.

60
00:05:31,782 --> 00:05:39,718
And what we're giving out is basically
exclusive rights to use mathematics, -

61
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:44,883
-to use a law of nature, in whatever context.
And what we get in return is basically nothing.

62
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:52,121
- The patents is a government grant, in the US it
arises out of the constitution.

63
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:58,721
- The Framers included the provision for granting
exclusive rights to inventors in our constitution,

64
00:05:58,971 --> 00:06:06,093
and the belief was that that was important in order
to reward people who had made technological -

65
00:06:06,243 --> 00:06:09,343
- advances that would benefit society.

66
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:18,156
- The rights that they are granted are not the rights
to do the things that they invent, -

67
00:06:18,406 --> 00:06:21,409
-but the right to exclude others from doing
that thing.

68
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:28,345
- So the idea was you have a machine or a thing,
which is not previously described in any literature, -

69
00:06:28,595 --> 00:06:34,449
-and which no skilled mechanic could figure out
how to make given what is described in literature, -

70
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:36,457
-and for that you get a patent.

71
00:06:36,707 --> 00:06:42,550
- The basis for determining what is patentable
subject matter has continued to evolve -

72
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,300
- over the last 200 years of our national existence.

73
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:54,588
- In 1953 the Patent Act was modified by Congress,
to add the words "or processes" to the word -

74
00:06:54,838 --> 00:06:57,697
- "product" in describing what could be patented.

75
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:10,833
The Congress which did that was plainly thinking of
processes of industrial manufacture. Processes -

76
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:19,481
- that produced something at the other end. Float
glass on molten tin, and it'll become flat, or whatever.

77
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:25,065
- And it's unlikely that anybody thought of process
at that time in terms of computer software, -

78
00:07:25,315 --> 00:07:33,748
-because we didn't have applications on computer
software for many years after that last revision -

79
00:07:33,998 --> 00:07:36,998
- of the Patent Act.

80
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:52,282
- Back in the late 70s the patent law was interpreted
such that you couldn't patent software. It was -

81
00:07:52,532 --> 00:07:55,449
- considered a mathematical algorithm,
a law of nature.

82
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:09,430
The legal world changed. The environment was
quite different starting with some decisions by-

83
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:11,254
- the Supreme Court, like Diamond v. Diehr.

84
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:17,905
- The patent applicant was coming in with a new
process for curing rubber. The temperature, and-

85
00:08:18,155 --> 00:08:23,873
- the preciseness of the temperature is essentials
in curing rubber well. And the innovation -

86
00:08:24,123 --> 00:08:30,753
-that was being patented in this case was an
algorithm to monitor a thermometer -

87
00:08:31,003 --> 00:08:37,038
- that was basically in the process and determined
when the rubber needs to be released and cooled.

88
00:08:37,288 --> 00:08:42,505
- And they said "Processes for curing rubber are
patentable, there's nothing new about that, -"

89
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:47,526
"- the fact that they use a computer in implementing
it shouldn't change anything."

90
00:08:55,602 --> 00:09:00,070
- The Supreme Court makes it clear that you can't
patent software, because it's only a set of -

91
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:09,300
- instructions, or an algorithm. Abstract laws of nature,
algorithms, are unpatentable in the US itself.

92
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:17,209
However, then there was the creation of the
Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit.

93
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:24,657
- The problem being solved, in some sense, begins
with the fact that trial court judges always -

94
00:09:24,907 --> 00:09:27,180
- hate patent cases.

95
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:35,310
And the reason they hate patent cases is, for a single
trial judge, a lawyer who has spent his/her life-

96
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:43,914
-doing litigation, a patent case in which she/he is going
to be required to find detailed facts about how paint is-

97
00:09:44,164 --> 00:09:52,713
-made or how computers work or how radio broadcast-
ing operates, is an opportunity just to made into a fool.

98
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:05,369
- Congress is attempting to change the system in which
patent cases are litigated.

99
00:10:05,619 --> 00:10:11,934
But instead of changing who tried patent cases,
Congress left a non-specialist district judge-

100
00:10:12,184 --> 00:10:17,326
-in charge of the trial. And then created a new court of
appeals called the Federal Circuit,-

101
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:22,081
-who's job it was to hear all appeals from patent cases.

102
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:25,313
Rapidly, of course, this court filled up with
patent lawyers.

103
00:10:25,563 --> 00:10:32,622
And the patent lawyers then made the law in the court
of appeals that applied to all those district judges-

104
00:10:32,872 --> 00:10:37,556
-who were still making non-specialist decisions of
which they were afraid.

105
00:10:37,806 --> 00:10:42,721
Naturally the Federal Circuit turned out to be a place
which loved patents.

106
00:10:42,971 --> 00:10:49,537
And it's chief judge, Giles Rich, who lived to be very
very old and died in his late 90s,-

107
00:10:49,787 --> 00:10:53,068
-was a man who particularly loved patents on
everything.

108
00:10:53,318 --> 00:11:00,273
The Federal Circuit court under Giles Rich sort of broke
Diamond against Diehr lose from it's original meaning,-

109
00:11:00,523 --> 00:11:05,068
-and came to the conclusion that software itself
could be patented.

110
00:11:05,318 --> 00:11:09,609
- The Supreme Court basically left everything to
this court to decide.

111
00:11:09,859 --> 00:11:16,473
- The PTO actually used to reject patents on software,
like in the early 1990s, and they did not allowed them.

112
00:11:16,723 --> 00:11:20,223
And the applicants would appeal those
rejections to the Federal Circuit.

113
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,798
- In the world of machines you show the Patent Office
the machine,-

114
00:11:47,048 --> 00:11:51,697
-and you've got a Patent Office who's claims were
"I claim this machine."

115
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:56,636
In the world of computer software there was no way
of defining what the unit was.

116
00:11:56,886 --> 00:12:03,777
I don't claim a program, I claim a technique that any
number of programs doing any number of things could-

117
00:12:04,027 --> 00:12:11,492
-possibly use. The consequence of which is very rapidly
we began to build up as real estate that somebody-

118
00:12:11,742 --> 00:12:19,014
-owned and could exclude other people from a whole
lot of basic techniques in computer programming.

119
00:12:19,314 --> 00:12:24,516
- What happened was, starting in the mid-90s, the
number of patents on software started soaring.

120
00:12:24,766 --> 00:12:27,806
An industry attitude started changing too.

121
00:12:28,056 --> 00:12:32,558
So you had Microsoft, which originally didn't deal
with software patents very much at all,-

122
00:12:32,808 --> 00:12:36,885
-I guess they got sued in the early 90s
by Stac and lost a, uh,-

123
00:12:37,085 --> 00:12:40,817
-significant judgment against them,
they started patenting.

124
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:43,932
- They're gonna have their own set of patents.

125
00:12:44,182 --> 00:12:49,116
So that if a major patent holder threatens them,
they can fire back.

126
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:55,382
- Gradually companies like Oracle were forced to set
up patent departments just for defensive reasons.

127
00:12:55,632 --> 00:13:00,481
They had to patent their stuff so that they had some-
thing to trade with the companies that had patents.

128
00:13:00,731 --> 00:13:10,945
<i>Mark Webbink:
- And so the arsenal started to develop. By year 2001
Microsoft now holds thousands of software patents.</i>

129
00:13:11,195 --> 00:13:15,350
<i>Oracle was probably approaching a thousand software
patents. Adobe...</i>

130
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,713
<i>James Bessen:
- All of them become more and more aggressive.
Patenters and some of the ones who were against-</i>

131
00:13:19,963 --> 00:13:25,516
<i>-software patents ended up suing other companies,
and so what you had is an explosion of patenting first-</i>

132
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:27,729
<i>-and then an explosion of litigation.</i>

133
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:37,404
By the late 90s about a quarter of all patents
granted were software patents.

134
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:44,233
About a third of all litigation, patent litigation,
involves software patents.

135
00:13:44,483 --> 00:13:50,329
About 40% of the cost of litigation is
attributable to software patents.

136
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,631
And those numbers have been going up.

137
00:13:52,881 --> 00:13:59,270
So Charles Freeny invented a kiosk that goes in retail
stores, and the idea is you'd come in,-

138
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:05,306
-you could select the music selection, swipe your
credit card, put in a blank 9 track tape,-

139
00:14:05,556 --> 00:14:10,917
-and this is is how long ago this patent was, and it
would write that music selection onto the tape-

140
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:13,988
-and you could go away with it.

141
00:14:14,238 --> 00:14:21,649
The patent was drafted in a very vague language so
there were terms like "point of sale location",-

142
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:25,060
-and "information manufacturing machine".

143
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:32,902
And Freeny eventually sold this patent to somebody
who wanted to interpret those terms very broadly.

144
00:14:33,352 --> 00:14:36,652
To basically cover e-commerce.

145
00:14:36,902 --> 00:14:44,956
So here was this very limited invention for this kiosk,
and he wanted to interpret those terms in such a-

146
00:14:45,206 --> 00:14:50,102
-broad way so that it would cover transactions that
took place over the Internet,-

147
00:14:50,352 --> 00:14:56,228
-you could make them in your office, in your
bedroom, in your house, anywhere.

148
00:14:56,478 --> 00:15:00,817
And so it covered virtually all of e-commerce.

149
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:08,382
The courts initially didn't agree with that interpretation
but they appealed it, and the appellant court largely-

150
00:15:08,632 --> 00:15:16,254
agreed with them, and they were able to extract some
settlements out of well over a hundred companies.

151
00:15:16,504 --> 00:15:23,452
But the significant thing is, here is this patent you
can't tell what it's boundaries were until you get to-

152
00:15:23,702 --> 00:15:29,236
-the appellant court. What most people thought
it's boundaries were turned out to be wrong.

153
00:15:29,486 --> 00:15:32,644
- One of the key properties of programming languages
is they're very very precise.

154
00:15:32,894 --> 00:15:39,292
You can look at any program language in any language,
in C, Python, any language like this,-

155
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:43,910
-and you know exactly what it's doing. You can look
at two pieces of service code and you can say-

156
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,662
"Are this doing the same thing or different things?"
And we do this because computers are very picky-

157
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:53,801
-and we need to tell the computer exactly what we
need to do in order to accomplish some task.

158
00:15:54,051 --> 00:15:57,551
The language patent lawyers use is almost the opposite.

159
00:15:57,801 --> 00:16:03,001
There's an advantage in being vague, and being broad,
being non-specific, because the broader your language-

160
00:16:03,251 --> 00:16:06,751
-the more things you, sort of, catch in your net.

161
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:12,361
- So it is a large problem in our patent system just
defining simply what is the context or the borders-

162
00:16:12,611 --> 00:16:16,148
-of the patent. And what does it cover,
and what does it not cover.

163
00:16:16,398 --> 00:16:21,658
And that ambiguity causes a lot of chilling effects,
because people are going to avoid doing anything-

164
00:16:21,908 --> 00:16:27,013
-that could possibly be covered by the patent, even if in
reality the patent wouldn't cover what they wanna do.

165
00:16:27,263 --> 00:16:33,406
- Let's imagine that in the 1700s the governments of
Europe had decided to promote the progress of-

166
00:16:33,656 --> 00:16:41,162
-symphonic music, or as they thought, promote it.
Will a system of musical idea patents, meaning-

167
00:16:41,412 --> 00:16:48,306
-anybody who could describe a new musical idea in
words could get a patent which would be a monopoly-

168
00:16:48,556 --> 00:16:54,998
-on that idea and then he could sue anybody else
that implemented that idea in a piece of music.

169
00:16:55,248 --> 00:17:09,121
So a rhythmic pattern could be patented, or a sequence
of chords, or a set of instruments to use together,-

170
00:17:09,371 --> 00:17:17,212
-or any idea you could describe in words. Now imagine
it's 1800 and you're Beethoven, and you want to write-

171
00:17:17,462 --> 00:17:23,748
-a symphony. You're gonna find it's harder to write a
symphony that you won't get sued for, than write-

172
00:17:23,998 --> 00:17:29,102
-a symphony that sounds good. Because to write a
symphony and not get sued you're gonna have to-

173
00:17:29,302 --> 00:17:34,638
-tread your way around thousands of
musical idea patents.

174
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:40,388
And if you complained about this, saying it's getting in
the way of your creativity, the patent holders would-

175
00:17:40,638 --> 00:17:44,484
-say "Oh, Beethoven you're just jealous because we
had these ideas before you."

176
00:17:44,651 --> 00:17:46,873
"Why should you steal our ideas?"

177
00:17:47,123 --> 00:17:52,634
- People have been making music for thousands of
years. There were never any need for patents in-

178
00:17:52,884 --> 00:18:01,148
-the field of music. And since the computer industry
has made programming possible, people have been-

179
00:18:01,398 --> 00:18:07,054
-developing software as well, since right from its
beginning, there was never a need to have patents-

180
00:18:07,304 --> 00:18:10,516
-in this field in order for the activity to happen.

181
00:18:10,766 --> 00:18:20,582
- Almost everything we were doing back before 1980,
1981, in those things, patent played no role in it.

182
00:18:20,832 --> 00:18:30,324
Cut & paste, the embedded ruler in a word processing,
word wrapping, a lot of the things that are real-

183
00:18:30,574 --> 00:18:37,566
-important and we take for granted, and that are much
more innovative in many ways than patents we have-

184
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:44,198
-today, 'cos patents can be on some very minute
things, that's the way the law works.

185
00:18:44,448 --> 00:18:49,841
Those things happened, we had great
advances without patents.

186
00:18:50,091 --> 00:18:54,100
- One of the world's most respected computer scientists,

187
00:18:54,350 --> 00:19:02,422
Donald Knuth, has said that if software patents had
been available in the 1960s and 70s when he was-

188
00:19:02,672 --> 00:19:07,084
-doing his work, that it's probably the case that
computer science wouldn't be where it is today.

189
00:19:07,334 --> 00:19:15,164
There would be blockades on innovation that could've
seriously prevented the kinds of technical solutions-

190
00:19:15,414 --> 00:19:17,942
-that we take for granted today.

191
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:24,137
- The programmer writing a long program might
conceivably need to check whether 500 or-

192
00:19:24,387 --> 00:19:28,622
-thousand different techniques are patented, and there
is no way that she possibly could.

193
00:19:28,872 --> 00:19:35,590
- The Patent Office issues hundreds of software patents
all the time. Every Tuesday they issue 3,500 patents-

194
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:41,032
-and a large number of those relate to software. It's
just impossible to review all those patents every week-

195
00:19:41,232 --> 00:19:43,580
-to make sure you're not doing something that could
infringe them.

196
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:53,505
- So there's a provision in the US patent laws that
basically holds patent infringers, ahem, at I guess-

197
00:19:53,755 --> 00:20:01,117
-a greater liability if they are shown to willfully
infringe. So basically the idea is that if you knew-

198
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:07,094
-about a patent and you infringed on it, you should
have a stricter penalty than if you didn't know about it.

199
00:20:07,344 --> 00:20:14,356
But what this results in is a situation where there is a
real disincentive to follow what patent has been made-

200
00:20:14,606 --> 00:20:21,228
-and what new inventions there has been through the
patent system, because if you read every patent or-

201
00:20:21,478 --> 00:20:28,070
-there's evidence to show that you have read patents,
then you are liable for willful infringement, you knew-

202
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,737
-about the patent and you infringed it anyway, and the
penalty is triple damages.

203
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:39,137
<i>- A number of people suggested that software
should be removed from the-</i>

204
00:20:39,387 --> 00:20:40,760
<i>-scope of patentability. Can you comment on that?</i>

205
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:45,894
- Yes, well, I obviously disagree with that. And I don't
believe that software should ever be removed.

206
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:51,441
It's one of our greatest sources of technical innovation
in this country. And to come up with a test that would-

207
00:20:51,691 --> 00:20:55,230
-somehow eliminate software would,
I think, be a disaster for the economy.

208
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:01,852
WOULD IT THOUGH?
- Mike and I estimate that outside of pharmaceuticals
and chemicals the patents, sort of, are acting like-

209
00:21:02,102 --> 00:21:10,454
-10 or 20 percent tax. You know, the small developer
developing something, down the road he has to pay-

210
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:18,892
-that tax. And every small company I know in software,
as long as they've been around a few years and hit-

211
00:21:19,142 --> 00:21:26,950
-the market, somebody is asserting a patent against
them, they're running into some potential difficulties.

212
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,609
They very frequently feel obligated to get patent
themselves for defensive purposes.

213
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:40,646
So all of that activity is a tax. It's not something that's
helping them innovate, it's an unnecessary activity.

214
00:21:40,896 --> 00:21:47,313
- The primary thing we do is an issue tracking system
called RT, or Request Tracker, so it's customer service,-

215
00:21:47,563 --> 00:21:53,506
-help desk, bug tracking, network operations, anything
where you've got a whole bunch of tasks that need to-

216
00:21:53,756 --> 00:21:58,089
-get kept track of. And you need to know what
happened, what didn't happen, who did it,-

217
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:04,609
-who didn't do it, when. It's kind of a to do list on
steroids designed for a whole organization.

218
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:10,297
Pretty much everything is open source or free software,
under one license or another.

219
00:22:10,547 --> 00:22:18,009
We'll get consulting customers or support costumers
who add indemnification language to our standard-

220
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:27,038
-contract or need us to sign theirs. And it says, in the
standard legalese, it's gonna say something like-

221
00:22:27,288 --> 00:22:34,324
-we indemnify and hold them harmless and agree to
pay their legal fees and sacrifice our first-born, if-

222
00:22:34,574 --> 00:22:41,468
-something happens and someone discover that our
software is violating a somebody else's patent.

223
00:22:41,718 --> 00:22:46,276
It's very very rarely the case that we end up signing
something that has that kind of language in it.

224
00:22:46,526 --> 00:22:48,476
But it eats up a lot of legal fees.

225
00:22:48,726 --> 00:22:59,648
- Look at the innovative people in software in ICT,
and ask "Would they be better of if the patent system-

226
00:22:59,898 --> 00:23:03,161
-was abolished?" The answer is probable "Yes".

227
00:23:03,411 --> 00:23:11,472
- Who's benefiting? Patent lawyers is number one.
Number two, you've a small number of so called-

228
00:23:11,722 --> 00:23:17,822
-trolls who are benefiting, but it's not clear even most
of them is making much money.

229
00:23:18,072 --> 00:23:25,580
You're seeing more recently, in the last 4 or 5 years,
companies like Intellectual Ventures and-

230
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:32,364
-hedge fonds who are acquiring large volumes of these
trash patents and using them to extract hundreds-

231
00:23:32,614 --> 00:23:38,129
-of millions of dollars from companies. They're
benefiting, they maybe the biggest beneficiaries.

232
00:23:38,379 --> 00:23:42,872
- There's a lot of bad press in the last few years
about the harm that's caused by software patents.

233
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:49,268
And we think that's had a political influence on the PTO
to get them to slow down their issuance and start-

234
00:23:49,518 --> 00:23:51,444
-rejecting them, and that's what has
resulted in the Bilski case.

235
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:07,630
- Well the biggest, first bad press story was the
Blackberry patents, where all the Congressional-

236
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,228
-representatives have their Blackberrys and there was
a company called NTP that sued the manufacture of-

237
00:24:12,478 --> 00:24:17,425
-Blackberry saying that all Blackberrys infringed it's
patent. Well, NTP was this company which is just a-

238
00:24:17,675 --> 00:24:22,532
-one person holding company, they didn't make any
products or services themselves, and so-

239
00:24:22,782 --> 00:24:29,764
-this got a lot of attention in the Wall street Journal and
Washington Post, and Congress persons were really-

240
00:24:30,014 --> 00:24:34,039
-upset that they may lose their Blackberrys and they
may not be able to communicate efficiently.

241
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:40,950
So that caused a lot of attention, then you had all these
patents on banking methods and imaging for checks,-

242
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,188
-those patent holders were asserting against the
banking industry, and the banking industry has-

243
00:24:44,438 --> 00:24:47,686
-a lot of influence on Capitol Hill, and so they've been
going down there and saying "Look, these types of-

244
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:52,553
-patents are causing us lots of harm." Then you add
into that the whole patent troll phenomenon in-

245
00:24:52,803 --> 00:24:58,457
-Eastern District of Texas, with small patent holders
suing large IT companies like Google, Microsoft-

246
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:04,293
-IBM and Hewlett Packard. And all these companies
also have legislative influence, and they've said-

247
00:25:04,543 --> 00:25:08,612
-"These types of patents are causing real harm to our
business, they're costing us jobs, they're increasing-

248
00:25:08,862 --> 00:25:13,881
-the price of products and services that we offer to our
customers, and you need to do something about it."

249
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:27,428
- The situation we find ourselves in is that the lower
court, the Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit,-

250
00:25:27,678 --> 00:25:32,140
-is essentially a court for patents,
for hearing patent cases.

251
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:40,741
And this is the first time the Supreme Court has
taken up that scope of patentability.

252
00:25:40,991 --> 00:25:47,852
And specifically this test that was implemented by
lower court, does talk to software patents.

253
00:25:48,102 --> 00:25:55,724
And so, it's basically a 20 year history of software
patents being granted due to the lower court.

254
00:25:55,974 --> 00:26:01,286
And so, we're hoping that the Supreme Court will
clear up the mess that the lower courts created.

255
00:26:01,536 --> 00:26:06,065
And restamp it's authority which basically said that
you cannot have software patents.

256
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:12,078
- When you saw the arguments that where brought
by Bilski's lawyer, the patent bar is in some sense-

257
00:26:12,328 --> 00:26:21,238
-an organized lobby. And an expansive subject matter
that's available to be patented is in their interest.

258
00:26:21,488 --> 00:26:26,406
And it's clear that that was frustrating to some of the
justices. Some of them were frustrated by how-

259
00:26:26,656 --> 00:26:28,685
-expansive patentable subject matter has become.

260
00:26:28,935 --> 00:26:34,553
- They seem somewhat dismissive of the idea that
you could patent this particular idea.

261
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:40,169
- I think people has a hard time getting over the idea
that you can get a patent on hedging commodity-

262
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:45,580
-risk. But if you actually look at the claims and look
at what's in there, it is a process and it's no-

263
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:50,080
-different than any other process. It just may be
that it's not the way that they thought of patent-

264
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:51,817
-law in the past.

265
00:26:52,067 --> 00:26:56,321
- We were encouraged by the comments by the
justices which showed that they were skeptical-

266
00:26:56,571 --> 00:27:02,630
-and which suggested that they understood that
software is little more than a series of steps,-

267
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,441
-that could be written out as mathematical formula,
or written out on a piece of paper, or, as was-

268
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:11,638
-mentioned by one of the justices,
typed out on a typewriter.

269
00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:17,117
- Software patents on a general purpose computer
have never been explicitly endorsed by this court.

270
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:23,798
And this court has also shown no compunction about
reversing rules that've held for a very a long time.

271
00:27:24,048 --> 00:27:27,662
They clearly thought that the petitioners here was
trying to get a patent on something very basic,-

272
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:29,924
-some basic forms of human activity.

273
00:27:30,174 --> 00:27:34,861
MORE THAN 200,000 SOFTWARE PATENTS
HAVE BEEN GRANTED IN THE U.S.

274
00:27:35,611 --> 00:27:42,489
PROGRAMMERS FIND IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT
TO WRITE SOFTWARE THEY WON'T BE LIABLE
TO BE SUED FOR

275
00:27:42,739 --> 00:27:46,239
NOW IMAGINE...
